First FinalProject called Event_Handler by Group4.

Main idea is to create an application, where a person can search for different events.

For searching different events we have different options how to search:

    - searching by date.
    - searching by location.
    - searching by genre.
    - searching by price range.
    - searching by type of the event.
    - get all events.
And then we have 2 options, which is available for only registered users.

    - adding event.
    - deleting event.

We also have a user database, where to create, read and delete users.
